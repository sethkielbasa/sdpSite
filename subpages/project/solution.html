		I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation.<br><br>

		Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, signed the Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous 
		decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It came as 
		a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity.<br><br>

		But one hundred years later, the Negro still is not free; one hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of 
		segregation and the chains of discrimination; one hundred years later, the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean 
		of material prosperity; one hundred years later, the Negro is still languished in the corners of American society and finds himself in exile in his own land.

		<div id="two" style="overflow:auto">
		So we've come here today to dramatize a shameful condition. In a sense we've come to our nation’s capital to cash a check. When the architects 
		of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which
		every American was to fall heir. This note was the promise that all men, yes, black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed the unalienable 
		ights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
		<br><br>
		It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note in so far as her citizens of color are concerned. Instead of honoring this 
		sacred obligation, America has given the Negro people a bad check, a check which has come back marked “insufficient funds.” But we refuse to 
		believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. We refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation. 
		And so we have come to cash this check, a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justice.
		</div>
		<div id="three" style="overflow:auto">
		We have also come to this hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of now. This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling 
		off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism. Now is the time to make the real the promises of democracy; now is the time to rise from 
		the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice; now is the time to lift our nation from the quicksands of racial 
		injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood; now is the time to make justice a reality for all of God’s children. It would be fatal for the nation to 
		overlook the urgency of the moment. This sweltering summer of the Negro’s legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn
		of freedom and equality. Nineteen sixty-three is not an end, but a beginning. And those who hope that the Negro needed to blow off steam and 
		will now be content, will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business as usual. There will be neither rest nor tranquility in America until 
		the Negro is granted his citizenship rights. The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of
		justice emerges.
		</div>
		<div id="four" style="overflow:auto">
		But there is something that I must say to my people, who stand on the worn threshold which leads into the palace of justice. In the process 
		of gaining our rightful place, we must not be guilty of wrongful deeds. Let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the 
		cup of bitterness and hatred. We must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity and discipline. We must not allow our creative
		protests to degenerate into physical violence. Again and again we must rise to the majestic heights of meeting physical force with soul force.
		The marvelous new militancy, which has engulfed the Negro community, must not lead us to a distrust of all white people. For many of our
		white brothers, as evidenced by their presence here today, have come to realize that their destiny is tied up with our destiny. And they have
		come to realize that their freedom is inextricably bound to our freedom. We cannot walk alone. And as we walk, we must make the pledge that 
		we shall always march ahead. We cannot turn back.
