				We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union,
				establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common
				defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to
				ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the
				United States of America.<br><br>
				Article 1. <br><br>

				Section 1 <br>
				All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the
				United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives.
				<br><br>
				Section 2 <br>
				The House of Representatives shall be composed of Members chosen every second
				Year by the People of the several States, and the Electors in each State shall
				have the Qualifications requisite for Electors of the most numerous Branch of
				the State Legislature.
			</div>
			<div id="designThree" style="display:none">
				No Person shall be a Representative who shall not have attained to the Age of
				twenty five Years, and been seven Years a Citizen of the United States, and who
				shall not, when elected, be an Inhabitant of that State in which he shall be
				chosen.<br><br>

				Representatives and direct Taxes shall be apportioned among the several States
				which may be included within this Union, according to their respective Numbers,
				which shall be determined by adding to the whole Number of free Persons,
				including those bound to Service for a Term of Years, and excluding Indians not
				taxed, three fifths of all other Persons.
				<br><br>
				The actual Enumeration shall be made within three Years after the first Meeting
				of the Congress of the United States, and within every subsequent Term of ten
				Years, in such Manner as they shall by Law direct. The Number of
				Representatives shall not exceed one for every thirty Thousand, but each State
				shall have at Least one Representative; and until such enumeration shall be
				made, the State of New Hampshire shall be entitled to choose three,
				Massachusetts eight, Rhode Island and Providence Plantations one, Connecticut

				Section 3<br>
				The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators from each
				State, chosen by the Legislature thereof, for six Years; and each Senator shall
				have one Vote.
				<br><br>
				Immediately after they shall be assembled in Consequence of the first Election,
				they shall be divided as equally as may be into three Classes. The Seats of the
				Senators of the first Class shall be vacated at the Expiration of the second
				Year, of the second Class at the Expiration of the fourth Year, and of the
				third Class at the Expiration of the sixth Year, so that one third may be
				chosen every second Year; and if Vacancies happen by Resignation, or otherwise,
				during the Recess of the Legislature of any State, the Executive thereof may
				make temporary Appointments until the next Meeting of the Legislature, which
				shall then fill such Vacancies.

				in the absence of the Vice President, or when he shall exercise the Office of
				President of the United States.
				<br><br>
				The Senate shall have the sole Power to try all Impeachments. When sitting for
				that Purpose, they shall be on Oath or Affirmation. When the President of the
				United States is tried, the Chief Justice shall preside: And no Person shall be
				convicted without the Concurrence of two thirds of the Members present.
				<br><br>
				Judgment in Cases of Impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from
				Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or
				Profit under the United States: but the Party convicted shall nevertheless be
				liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to
				Law.
				<br>
				Section 4<br>
				The Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and
				Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof;
				but the Congress may at any time by Law make or alter such Regulations, except
				as to the Place of Choosing Senators.
				The Congress shall assemble at least once in every Year, and such Meeting shall
				be on the first Monday in December, unless they shall by Law appoint a
				different Day.
